# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Austin Lot Analyzer

## Get Started in 10 Minutes

### 1. Install Proxy Server (2 min)
```bash
# In your project directory
npm install
```

### 2. Start Proxy Server (1 min)
```bash
# In one terminal window
npm start
```

### 3. Open the Website (1 min)
```bash
# In another terminal window
open index.html
```

### 4. Test with Real Austin Addresses (5 min)

Try these addresses in the search box:

#### Known Good Test Addresses:
- `1000 Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78701` - State Capitol area
- `4400 Avenue G, Austin, TX 78751` - Hyde Park (large lot)
- `1500 W 35th St, Austin, TX 78703` - Tarrytown (corner lot)

### 5. What You'll See

When it's working correctly:
- ‚úÖ Property data loads (address, lot size, zoning)
- ‚úÖ Analysis shows if lot can be split
- ‚úÖ Plot map displays (if dimensions available)

Current limitations:
- ‚ùå Map view needs Mapbox token
- ‚ùå Some properties may not have complete data
- ‚ùå HOA/deed restrictions not available

### 6. Check Console for Errors

Press F12 to open browser console. Look for:
- `Proxy server running` message
- Any red error messages
- CORS errors (should be fixed by proxy)

## Troubleshooting

### "Property not found"
- Try different address format (with/without unit numbers)
- Some newer properties may not be in GIS yet
- Check if proxy server is running

### CORS Errors
- Make sure proxy server is running on port 3000
- Check `http://localhost:3000/health` in browser

### No Lot Dimensions
- Not all properties have dimension data in GIS
- Manual entry may be needed for accurate split visualization
