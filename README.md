# üè† Austin Lot Analyzer - Real Estate Mentor Program

A web-based tool designed to help identify properties in Austin, TX with lot splitting potential for profitable real estate investment.

## üéØ Project Goal

Find properties that can be purchased, split into multiple lots, renovated, and sold profitably. The ideal scenario:
- Buy a property for $500K
- Split the lot into two parcels
- Renovate and sell the original house for $500K
- Keep the second lot for free (or sell for additional profit)

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Open the Application
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No installation required!

### 2. Upload Property Data
- Export property listings from Zillow or Realtor.com as CSV files
- Drag and drop the CSV file onto the upload area, or click to browse
- The app supports various CSV formats with common field names

### 3. Configure Analysis Parameters
Adjust the settings based on your investment criteria:
- **Maximum Purchase Price**: Your budget limit
- **Minimum Lot Size**: Smallest lot you'll consider
- **Target Profit Margin**: Your desired return percentage
- **Renovation Budget**: How much you plan to spend on improvements

### 4. Analyze Properties
Click "Analyze Properties" to run the analysis. The tool will:
- Check if each property meets your size and price criteria
- Verify lot splitting potential based on Austin zoning laws
- Calculate financial viability and profit projections
- Score each property from 0-100 based on investment potential

### 5. Review Results
Properties are ranked by their overall score:
- **Excellent (80-100)**: Prime investment opportunities
- **Good (60-79)**: Solid potential with some considerations
- **Poor (0-59)**: May not meet your criteria

### 6. Export Results
